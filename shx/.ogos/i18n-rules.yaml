# Configuration for the localization process.
# This file defines how source files are processed, translated, and localized.

# --- Translator Settings ---
# Defines the translation service to be used.
# Supported translators are based on the 'deep_translator' library (e.g., 'google', 'pons', 'linguee', 'mytmemory').
translator: "google"

# --- Language Settings ---
# Defines the source and target languages for translation.
# The codes should be specified in a way that 'deep_translator' understands.
# The engine will automatically handle mappings (e.g., zh-Hant -> zh-TW).
languages:
  source: "cn" # The original language of the source file.
  targets:
    - "en"
    - "tw"
    - "jp"
    - "ru"
    - "kr"
    - "ir"

# --- Extraction Rules ---
# A list of rules to find and extract strings for translation from source files.
# You can define multiple regex patterns.
extraction_rules:
  - type: "regex"
    # This pattern captures strings within quotes for commands like Ask, Txt, Task, Err.
    pattern: '(echo\s+-e|echo|read\s+-(e|r)\s+-p)\s+"(?:(?:[^"]*(?<!\\)\$\(echo\s+-e\s+"[^"]*?"(?<!\\)\)\s*[^"]*?)|[^"]*)"'
    # The capture group index for the string to be extracted.
    # In the pattern above, group 2 is the text content inside the quotes.
    capture_group: 2
