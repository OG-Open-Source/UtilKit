# Supported translators are based on the 'deep_translator' library (e.g., 'google', 'pons', 'linguee', 'mytmemory').
translator: "google"

# --- Language Settings ---
# Defines the source and target languages for translation.
# The codes should be specified in a way that 'deep_translator' understands.

languages:
  source: "zh-Hant" # The original language of the source file.
  targets:
    - "en"
    - "zh-Hans"

# --- Extraction Rules ---
# A list of rules to find and extract strings for translation from source files.
# You can define multiple regex patterns.
extraction_rules:
  - type: "regex"
    # This pattern captures strings within quotes for commands like Ask, Txt, Task, Err.
    pattern: '(Ask|Txt|Task|Err)\s+"([^"]+)"'
    # The capture group index for the string to be extracted.
    # In the pattern above, group 2 is the text content inside the quotes.
